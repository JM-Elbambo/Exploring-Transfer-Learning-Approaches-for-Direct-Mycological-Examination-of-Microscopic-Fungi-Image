**Abstract**  
Fungal infections such as superficial mycoses are widespread and pose a global threat. Current diagnostic methods such as direct microscopic examination have limitations in terms of time and reliability. Meanwhile, transfer learning has proven successful in computer vision tasks but faces challenges when applied to mycological examination due to the unique characteristics of microscopic fungi. This research investigates transfer learning approaches using a pre-trained EfficientNet V2 model to classify microscopic fungi images. The models created were able to generalize and adapt the learned features to the microscopic images used in this study. One of the model in the experiments achieved an accuracy score of 85.48\% by just adding a few extra layers from the pre-trained model.
